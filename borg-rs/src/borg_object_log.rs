//! The session's object log: the objects the Borg uses, buys and picks up.
//!
//! Enabled with the environment variable `BORG_OBJECT_LOG=<file>`. When it is
//! unset the module does nothing at all: no file is opened, no line is
//! printed, and the run is the run without it. The log never presses a key
//! and never changes a decision, so the keypress stream of a run with the log
//! is the stream of a run without it.
//!
//! Every event is printed on the console (the game's stdout) and appended to
//! the file, numbered from 1, so the end-of-session feedback can point at a
//! line:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0007 turn 142 depth 23 quaff a Potion of Healing
//! 0008 turn 150 depth 0 buy a Scroll of Light at the General Store, cost 25 gold
//! 0009 turn 150 depth 0 acquire 2 x a Potion of Healing
//! ```
//!
//! Three kinds of event:
//!
//! * `quaff`, `read`, `use`, `zap` - the Borg used an object it carried.
//! * `buy` - the Borg bought an object, with the store and the item's cost
//!   (the price the Borg judged it at, not the store's own price).
//! * `acquire` - something appeared in the pack that was not there before.
//!   This is the player's side of the session: with the handover the player
//!   shops in town, and the pack is the only place that shows it. It cannot
//!   tell a purchase from a pickup, so it says `acquire` and not `buy`. The
//!   Borg's own purchases are not reported twice: they are the `buy` lines.
