//! Phase 4 of the town inventory redesign (borg-rs#36), slice 3: the
//! dispositions - for every stack carried and every stack in the Home,
//! keep, store, sell, drop or take.
//!
//! The rule is the owner's (2026-11-14): **value-ranked**.
//!
//! * a stack's **keep value** is the usefulness lost by not having it: its
//!   need value (the need curve with the stack against without it) plus
//!   its power value (the power `borg_power` loses without it, priced by
//!   the power need's curve). The caller supplies the raw facts - the
//!   need, the reduction, the power - since the power comes from the
//!   engine (a try-off, in production);
//! * **unknown** wearables and devices are kept until they are known (by
//!   use, a rune, or buying a copy) - stored in the Home if the weight
//!   asks for room; unknown potions and scrolls are sold, as today;
//! * a stack with **value** is kept; one **without** is sold if a shop
//!   buys it, else dropped; a stack bought this visit is never sold back
//!   (#37's Stay row);
//! * over the **weight** allowance, the kept stacks with the least value
//!   per weight go to the Home while it has slots;
//! * **Home** stacks with value are taken back while the pack has slots,
//!   the most valuable first; Home stacks without value are sold only when
//!   the sale pays gold, or when the Home needs the slot (owner,
//!   2026-11-14: under `birth_no_selling` a sale pays nothing, and the Home
//!   is a free stash).
//!
//! Two stages (owner, 2026-11-14): the dispositions are decided first,
//! and what they free - pack slots, weight, the sale proceeds - is what
//! the purchases are solved with. The joint form, where a sale is decided
//! by what its gold would buy, is phase 5. Under `birth_no_selling` (the
//! game's default) a sale pays nothing; it still frees the slot.
