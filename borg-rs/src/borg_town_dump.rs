//! The town-visit dump: an observation-only record of every town visit.
//!
//! Enabled with the environment variable `BORG_TOWN_DUMP=<file>`. When it is
//! unset the module does nothing at all: no file is opened, no decision is
//! recorded, and the run is the run without it.
//!
//! The dump is observation only. It never presses a key, never changes a
//! goal, never changes a setting and never changes what the Borg decides.
//! The keypress stream of a run with the dump enabled is therefore the same
//! as the stream of a run without it, so the C/Rust parity suites stay
//! valid.
//!
//! Two kinds of record are written, one JSON object per line:
//!
//! * `decision` - the town visit itself: the state (gold, depth, class,
//!   race, level, hp, the traits the town strategy reads, the pack, the
//!   equipment and the home), the stock of every shop with the price of
//!   every ware, and the decision the current policy took (the goal ware or
//!   item, the shop, and the Borg's own note saying why).
//! * `purchase` - a transaction that was actually carried out: the ware, the
//!   price and the gold before and after.
//!
//! The dump's job is to be the fixture the usefulness function is checked
//! against (real states, not a labelling input: the function is the
//! weighted deficit model of `borg_town_usefulness`, decided 2026-11-12,
//! not a table fitted to the dump) and the diff against the current
//! policy: the states are real, and the
//! disagreements come out on their own. So the record keeps the whole shop
//! stock (the wares that were *not* bought are the contrastive signal),
//! and it keeps the non-purchases (a decision to buy nothing is a
//! decision).
//!
//! ## The integer projection
//!
//! `BORG_TOWN_DUMP_INTEGERS=<file>` writes a second file: the same records
//! with **integers only**, a fixed field order and a version tag. The
//! descriptive records carry names, and a name is not comparable between two
//! runs; an integer is.
//!
//! That is the shape the record schema (P13) asks for: a versioned,
//! machine-readable line, integers only, a stable field order, a total
//! ordering. So the projection is here to be specified against, and to make
//! the two sides of a shadow-mode comparison (today's action and the plan's)
//! diffable as numbers.
//!
//! The projection is not the record schema: P13 wants the line to carry the
//! plan's decision as well, and to be replayable from its own logged
//! inputs. This one carries today's side only.
