//! Store interaction strategy
//!
//!   (1) Sell items to the home (for later use)
//!       optimize the stuff in the home... this involves buying and selling
//!       stuff not in the 'best' list.
//!       We sell anything we may need later (see step 4)
//!
//!   (2) Sell items to the shops (for money)
//!       We sell anything we do not actually need
//!
//!   (3) Buy items from the shops (for the player)
//!       We buy things that we actually need
//!
//!   (4) Buy items from the home (for the player)
//!       We buy things that we actually need (see step 1)
//!
//!   (5) Buy items from the shops (for the home)
//!       We buy things we may need later (see step 1)
//!
//!   (6) Buy items from the home (for the stores)
//!       We buy things we no longer need (see step 2)
//!
//!   The basic principle is that we should always act to improve our
//!   "status", and we should sometimes act to "maintain" our status,
//!   especially if there is a monetary reward.  But first we should
//!   attempt to use the home as a "stockpile", even though that is
//!   not worth any money, since it may save us money eventually.
