// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Borg state and the engine's entries into the Borg
//
// All Borg state is one `BorgState` (the C globals of borg/*.c). It is
// allocated on the first entry and never freed (the C globals lived for
// the whole process too), and it is reached only here: the engine calls
// into the Borg through four callbacks (the `inkey_hack` hook in borg.rs,
// the `EVENT_BELL` handler in borg_io.rs, the `EVENT_LEAVE_GAME` handler in
// borg_init.rs, and `do_cmd_borg` below), each of which goes through
// `enter`. `enter` hands the callback a `&mut BorgState`, and Borg code
// passes it down explicitly; no Borg code holds the state any other way.
//
// Nested entry (docs/SELF-REVIEW.md U1). A Borg call into the engine that
// waits for a key (a long `msg()` with `auto_more` off goes through
// `msg_flush` -> `anykey` -> `inkey_ex` -> the hook), rings the bell, or
// shows a message can run the Borg again while the outer Borg call is
// still running and holds its `&mut BorgState`. C has the same nesting (no
// guard in `inkey_ex`), so it is kept. To make it sound, every engine
// wrapper that can get there takes the caller's `&mut BorgState` and
// *lends* it for the duration of the engine call (`lend`): the nested
// entry then works on a reborrow of the caller's reference, which the
// caller cannot use until the engine call returns. A nested entry is
// reported on stderr (the harness keeps `stderr.log` per run). A nested
// entry from an engine call that does not lend the state would alias the
// outer reference; it cannot be made sound, so it panics (abort) after the
// report. The lending wrappers are: `msg`, `event_signal`,
// `event_signal_message_null`, `get_string`, `get_com`, `get_com_ex`,
// `get_quantity`, `target_set_interactive`, `screen_save`, `screen_load`,
// `Menu::select`, `project_from_player`, `do_cmd_wiz_cure_all` and
// `do_cmd_redraw`.

// Single thread (docs/SELF-REVIEW.md, review finding 3). The engine is
// single-threaded and calls the Borg only from its own thread. `enter` is
// `pub(crate)` and only the four callbacks call it; three of them are
// private `extern "C"` functions the Borg registers with the engine and
// `do_cmd_borg` is a private `#[no_mangle]` symbol, so no Rust code outside
// the crate can enter. `enter` also checks, on every entry, that the
// engine is set up (`z_info` and `player` allocated: every callback comes
// after `init_angband` and character creation) and that it runs on the
// thread of the first entry (a `ThreadId` compare). The safe wrappers
// below read engine globals; they are meant for Borg code, which only
// runs inside an entry, on the engine thread.

// A handle (`CarriedObject`, `StoreObject`, `GameObject`, `FloorObject`)
// is a raw pointer to an engine object plus a lifetime `'a`: the borrow of
// the state's `access` token it was made from (`inven_object(&st.access,
// i)`). Engine objects are freed or replaced only while the game runs,
// i.e. after the Borg returns a key, or inside an engine call that can run
// the game or the Borg again: exactly the calls that lend the state
// (`lend`, they take `&mut BorgState`). So:
//
// * a handle cannot be kept across a lending call: that call needs
//   `&mut st`, which conflicts with the shared borrow of `st.access` the
//   handle holds (a compile error, not a convention);
// * a handle cannot outlive the entry it was made in, nor be stored in
//   `BorgState` (which has no lifetime parameter): `st` itself is only
//   borrowed for the callback (`enter`);
// * the token must be the root state's own field: the constructors check
//   its address at run time (`check_access`), so a token of another
//   `BorgState` (or one moved out with `mem::swap`) panics instead of
//   making a handle that is not tied to the lent state.
//
// Handles stay `Copy` (copies share the lifetime). Mutating other fields
// of the state while a handle is alive is allowed (split borrows, e.g.
// `let BorgState { access, items, .. } = st;`).
