//! Phase 1 of the town inventory redesign (borg-rs#36): the usefulness
//! function, the swept judgement of the plan.
//!
//! One town visit produces one plan: what to keep, store, sell and drop,
//! and what to buy, under one gold budget. Every candidate purchase is a
//! (need, reduction) pair priced by [`usefulness`]: the deficit of a
//! [`Need`] in the game's own units, weighted and discounted by the
//! flat-then-capped value curve decided on 2026-11-12 (B1):
//!
//! ```text
//! U_K(n) = w_K * min(1, n*r / g),    g = target - carried
//! ```
//!
//! The marginal value of a copy is the constant `w*r/g` until the deficit
//! closes, and zero at or above the target: a met need prices nothing.
//! (In integers the floor division lets a marginal exceed its predecessor
//! by at most one — rounding noise, not shape.) The curve is weakly
//! concave, so the group knapsack DP of phase 3 is exact (P15).
//!
//! Nothing calls this module yet: the plan itself is phase 4, and the
//! reduction table that maps a ware to its (need, reduction) pairs lands
//! with the catalogue of useful kinds (#35 item 4; planned for phase 2,
//! moved 2026-11-12 because the catalogue is still open). Every public
//! item therefore carries
//! `#[cfg_attr(not(test), expect(dead_code))]`: a marker that removes
//! itself when the first production caller lands.
