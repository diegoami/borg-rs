# The town inventory strategy: architecture

Status: **accepted, in implementation**. Phases 0-2 landed 2026-11-12 (the twelve settings in their six places; the usefulness function and the trip model; the stock and the budget). The owner decisions of 2026-11-12 (the epic log, full record on PR #42) are applied inline.

The decisions this rests on are recorded in borg-rs#36 (the epic), #37 (the extraction of the old strategy) and #35 (the evaluation). Where this document and an issue disagree, the epic's decision log (#36) wins and this document is wrong.

## The shape

One town visit is one plan. The plan answers, for every item the character has and every ware the shops hold:

- **keep** it (carry it),
- **store** it (put it in the Home, which is free and frees a pack slot),
- **sell** it (for gold),
- **drop** it,

and then it chooses **what to buy**, subject to the same budget. The plan is re-solved after every action, because every action changes the state.

Three things separate this from the strategy it replaces:

1. **The floors come first.** They are **kit predicates**, computed on the planned kit, not the carried one: at least one food, at least one light, a cure for the current condition, and a poison-cure capability. They are a constraint on the plan, never traded, and not priced - surviving is invaluable. When no affordable kit satisfies a floor the character leaves town with the floor unmet; what happens then is #37's Stay rules.
2. **The usefulness function is a parameter.** Worth is not a property of an object: it is the fraction of a **deficit** the item closes. The needs are light, food, bleeding, poison, escape, knowledge, power and trip, each with its own deficit arithmetic, and the weights are the owner's priorities over them. One weight vector is one zoo arm; the mechanism is written once and the judgement is measured.
3. **Everything is one optimisation.** The greedy comparison, the two gates in front of it, the exclusion-based sell decision and the Home's local search all go. What replaces them is a candidate list, a budget, an evaluation and a solver.

## The components

Five new modules in `borg-rs/src/`, and the existing code they replace or reuse.

### 1. The stock - what exists

`borg_town_stock.rs` (new)

Turns the world into the plan's input: the wares of every shop, the pack, the Home, and the character.

- the shop model already exists and is refreshed wholesale: `borg_notice_store` (`borg_store.rs:159-199`) reads every store's live stock and stores each ware's price (`borg_price_item`, `:193`). 8 shops x 24 slots (`store:inven-max:24`), of which seven are purchasable;
- the pack and the Home become **groups of stacks**, not lists of items: the Borg already knows whether two items stack - `borg_object_similar` (`borg_store_sell.rs:180`) - and that predicate is what decides whether a candidate costs a slot;
- the **alternatives** are computed here too, **kind-only** (decided 2026-11-12): the same kind at 1x in another shop is an alternative the plan compares against, which is what makes the Black Market's 3x price meaningful rather than arbitrary. Effect-equivalence across kinds is not attempted;

```rust
pub struct Candidate {
    pub shop: u8,        // 0..6; the Home is not a shop
    pub slot: u8,        // the slot in that shop's stock
    pub kind: u32,
    pub tval: u8, pub sval: u8,
    pub price: i32,      // per copy; what this shop charges (3x at the Black Market)
    pub qty: i32,        // the copies the shop holds
    pub weight: i32,     // per copy
    pub slots_cost: i32, // 0 if it stacks into an occupied slot, else 1
    pub stack_count: i32,// how many of this kind are already carried
    pub class: u16,      // the stack class: wares that stack together open one slot
}

pub struct KindOffer { pub kind: u32, pub wares: Vec<usize> } // cheapest first
// cost(n), weight(n), slots_cost(n), split(n): cumulative cheapest-n
```

As landed in phase 2 the candidate carries no `utility`: the evaluation is the solver's (phase 3), and it prices a kind's copies through the value curve rather than storing one number per ware. The stacking predicate is `borg_object_similar` in production and a parameter of the builder, so the suite runs without the engine.

### 2. The budget - what is feasible

`borg_town_budget.rs` (new)

Turns the state into the constraints the solver respects.

- **the floors** - computed first, from the character's needs, and never traded;
- **gold** - all the gold, minus what the floors cost. There is no trip reserve and no savings: the character arrives in the dungeon with an empty purse and a full plan;
- **pack slots** - 23 (`carry-cap:pack-size:23`), counted **per distinct stack**, not per copy;
- **home slots** - the overflow is bounded by the Home's slots, which the plan currently cannot see;
- **weight** - the carry allowance minus the carried weight; encumbrance is already priced into the power function (`borg_power.rs:1773-1824`), so this is a second, hard constraint on top of a soft one.

```rust
pub struct Budget {
    pub gold: i64,
    pub pack_slots: i32,
    pub home_slots: i32,
    pub weight: i64,
    pub floors: Vec<FloorPurchase>, // bought first, never traded; one copy each
    pub unmet: Vec<Need>,           // the floors the visit cannot meet
}
```

As landed in phase 2: the floor pass is exact over the at most four unmet floors, ordered by the most floors met, then the least gold, then the fewest wares, then the earliest wares; it is bounded by the gold alone. The floors are not priced, so the caution cap does not bind them. A floor no shop serves or the purse cannot pay for goes to `unmet` for #37's Stay rules (the infeasibility outcome itself stays a phase-4 entry criterion). The weight allowance is half of `BI_CARRY`, where `borg_trait` starts charging the encumbrance. The slot, Home and weight figures are signed: a negative one says the dispositions have to free room before the floors fit.

### 3. The usefulness function - what the character lacks

`borg_town_usefulness.rs` (new)

One function: the needs, their deficits, the weights, one caution. Landed in phase 1:

```rust
pub enum Need { Light, Food, Bleeding, Poison, Escape, Knowledge, Power, Trip }

pub struct Trip { /* the trip model: depth target, required light and food,
                     escapes needed, power target */ }

pub struct Weights {
    pub light: i64, pub food: i64, pub bleeding: i64, pub poison: i64,
    pub escape: i64, pub knowledge: i64, pub power: i64, pub trip: i64,
    pub caution: i64,    // the purse-share cap k: cost * k <= purse
}

pub fn value(weight: i64, reduction: i64, gap: i64, copies: i64) -> i64; // w*min(r*n, g)/g
pub fn marginal(weight: i64, reduction: i64, gap: i64, copy: i64) -> i64;
pub fn deficit(need: Need, st: &BorgState, trip: &Trip) -> i64;      // the target gap
pub fn usefulness(need: Need, reduction: i64, copies: i64,
                  st: &BorgState, trip: &Trip, weights: &Weights) -> i64;
pub fn unmet_floors(st: &BorgState) -> Vec<Need>;   // the kit predicates
```

The **reduction** is per-kind, so the phase-1 API takes it as a parameter. It was planned to arrive with the stock in phase 2; **corrected 2026-11-12**: the reduction table keys on the catalogue of useful kinds (#35 item 4), which is still open, so it lands with the catalogue - the phase-2 stock carries kind, tval and sval for it to key on, and the only part of the table phase 2 needs, the floors' classification, landed with the budget; the knowledge and trip deficits read 0 until their phases (the catalogue's arrival for knowledge, the stock's for the trip itself).

**The units.** The reductions are in different units - light in torches, food in rations, bleeding in wounds, power in power points - so they are normalised to **the fraction of the need closed** and the weight is what the *whole* need is worth. Each need is also split in two: the **floor** is the minimum that keeps the character alive - the kit predicates: at least one light, at least one food, a cure for the current condition, a poison-cure capability - and is a constraint that is never traded; the **target** is what the coming trip needs, and the gap between what the character has and the target is what gets priced. That split is the line the old emergency path drew by accident, and it is what makes the weights comparable. **Decided 2026-11-11** (the alternatives - gold as the unit, or the natural unit with the weight as the conversion - are not used); see #35.

- **the deficit** - how much of each need is unmet, from the character's state: `required_light - BI_LIGHT`, `required_food - BI_FOOD`, the bleed (`BI_ISCUT`), the poison (`BI_ISPOISONED` and `BI_ACUREPOIS == 0`), `escapes_needed - phase_doors_carried`, the still-unaware useful kinds, the marginal power, and the supplies the descent ahead needs. The raw material is already tracked (`borg_trait.rs`). The targets come from the trip model, landed provisionally with phase 1: depth target `BI_MAXDEPTH + 5`, required light 2 at or past the configured descent target (`borg_town_light_depth`) else 1, food per trip `borg_town_food_trip`, one escape per 10 levels, power target `2000 x depth target` - the weakest of the provisional values;
- **the reduction** - what the item closes. Each need defines its own arithmetic: light in torches, bleeding as a condition, power as a difference;
- **the value curve** - decided 2026-11-12: flat-then-capped, `U_K(n) = w_K * min(1, n*r/g)` with `g` the deficit. The marginal value is constant up to the cap, then zero - the curve is only *weakly* concave, which is what keeps the phase-3 DP exact. The old model has hard caps instead (`count_up`, `borg_power.rs:90-95`), an ad-hoc guess at "enough for a trip";
- **the power need** - the existing try-on (`borg_store_buy.rs:457-696`) already computes the marginal power of a candidate; the need reuses it;
- **the knowledge need** - two routes, compared: buy an unidentified copy of the kind (the price of the item, and the purchase identifies every copy of that kind the character carries) against an Identify Rune (200 at base, one unknown per scroll, and **no shop sells one** - it is a find, or a 600-gold Black Market purchase);
- **the caution** - a shop 6 candidate has to clear a share cap on the purse (`cost <= purse / k`) on top of the ordinary usefulness-versus-cost test.

### 4. The solver - what to buy

`borg_town_solve.rs` (new)

Given the candidates and the budget, return the chosen set, ranked.

- **knapsack** - the gold-only problem is an exact group DP for the decided weakly-concave values (`O(budget x kinds x copies)`, about 18M operations: milliseconds, and irrelevant next to the Borg's one decision per turn). The grouping is what makes the second copy of a kind free in slots and costed only in gold;
- **greedy over marginal gains** - the cheap heuristic: best marginal usefulness per gold, then repair. Not exact even gold-only - the worked instance under P15 has the greedy score 12 where the optimum is 18.

The solver is re-run after every action, so it never has to be trusted with a plan it computed before the state changed.

### 5. The plan - what to do next

`borg_town_plan.rs` (new)

The orchestrator, and the only place that decides.

```rust
pub enum TownAction {
    Buy  { shop: u8, slot: u8 },
    Sell { shop: u8, item: usize },
    Store{ item: usize },
    Take { item: usize },
    Drop { item: usize },
}

pub fn next_action(st: &mut BorgState) -> Option<TownAction>;
```

The cycle:

```
loop:
    candidates = stock()                       # every ware, every stack, every alternative
    floors    = budget::floors(state)          # the needs, computed first
    budget    = budget::of(state, floors)      # gold, slots, weight - after the floors
    chosen    = solve(candidates, budget)
    action    = first(floors, chosen)          # the floors come first
    if action is none:  leave the town;  break
    record(action)                             # what it was for, and what it displaced
    execute(action)                            # the existing goal interface
```

`borg_think_store.rs` keeps its job - it is the caller - and the old step order (deposit, sell, buy, take, grab, stock, swap, swap) is replaced by this one.

### 6. The executor and the record - what already exists

- the executors are reused as they are: a decision names a `(shop, ware)` goal and the existing code presses the keys (`borg_think_shop_buy`, `borg_store_buy.rs:1388`; `borg_think_shop_sell`, `borg_store_sell.rs:1117`);
- the **record** is the key log, and it has to show a *plan*: for each action, what it was for and what it displaced. The current notes (`# Buying '<item>'(<letter>) at '<shop>'`) say what happened; the redesign adds why;
- the key log is also the **parity surface**. The receipt compares the C's and the Rust's complete key logs - `harness/diff` over `keys.log`, `messages.log` and `state.log`, driven by `measurement-receipt.py` (`m2-parity`, and `parity-<suite>` for captured-rogue, endgame, extended, lunal-investigation and synthetic-tactics) and by `measurement-test.py`, which asserts `log('c', name) == log('rust', name)` for every configuration. **Every sale and every purchase the Borg makes is pinned byte-for-byte against the C Borg.** Changing the town strategy therefore breaks parity by construction - which is the real cost of the redesign, and the reason the arms are Rust-only.

### 7. The configuration

- a setting that turns the plan on, **default off**, so `main` keeps its behaviour, its suites and its validation receipt while the redesign is built;
- the weight vector, and the parameters (`k` for the share cap, the trip model's), settable per arm. Landed in phase 0: the twelve settings - `borg_town_plan`, the eight weights, `borg_town_share`, `borg_town_light_depth`, `borg_town_food_trip` - in their six places (see the plan document), the plan off by default.

## The optimisation problem

The whole town visit reduces to **one program over a decision vector**, with the arms differing only in a vector of parameters. This is the specification the implementation follows.

### The state (given)

The character, its pack, the Home, and every shop's stock and prices - all already available: `borg_notice_store` (`borg_store.rs:159-199`) refreshes the shops, and the Borg's traits carry the rest.

### The variables

| variable | domain | what it decides |
|---|---|---|
| `q_w` | 0 .. the stack of that ware | how many copies of each ware to buy |
| `d_i` | keep, store, sell, drop | what to do with each item in the pack |
| `e_j` | keep, take, sell | what to do with each item in the Home |
| `n_K` | 0 .. n | how many copies of each kind the character ends up carrying |

### The objective

```
maximise   Σ_K U_K(n_K)  +  Σ_{equipment} U(w)
```

where `U_K` is the usefulness of carrying `n` copies of kind `K`, and `U_K` is **weakly concave in `n`** - flat then capped: constant marginal value up to the deficit, zero beyond it (decided 2026-11-12).

The objective is evaluated on the **final kit**: what the character carries into the dungeon, after the sales, the stores, the withdrawals and the purchases. That is what makes the dispositions and the purchases *one* problem rather than two - selling an item is not a decision about that item, it is a decision to convert it into something else.

### The constraints

| constraint | statement |
|---|---|
| **gold** | `Σ_w q_w · price(w) ≤ gold + Σ_i [d_i = sell]·price(i) + Σ_j [e_j = sell]·price(j)` |
| **pack slots** | `#{K : n_K > 0} + #{equipment} ≤ free_pack_slots` (23, counted per distinct stack) |
| **home slots** | the number of items stored in the Home ≤ the Home's slots |
| **weight** | the carried weight ≤ the carry allowance (encumbrance, already priced by `borg_power.rs:1773-1824`) |
| **floors** | the planned kit satisfies the kit predicates: at least one food, at least one light, a cure for the current condition, a poison-cure capability |

The gold constraint is where the two sides couple: the proceeds of a sale are budget for a purchase.

### The parameters (the arm)

| parameter | what it is | swept? |
|---|---|---|
| `w_light, w_food, w_bleeding, w_poison, w_escape, w_knowledge, w_power, w_trip` | the owner's priority per need; the weight is what the **whole** need is worth. `w_light` is the numeraire, fixed at 100 - seven free weights | **yes** |
| `k_share` | the Black Market's share cap: `cost ≤ purse / k` | **yes** |
| the trip model's parameters | how `required_food`, `required_light` and `escapes_needed` are computed - one model, landed provisionally in phase 1, refined by the sweep | **yes** |
| the floor levels | the kit predicates: at least one food, at least one light, a cure for the current condition, a poison-cure capability | decided |
| the catalogue of useful kinds | which kinds the knowledge need counts | derived |
| the value curve | flat-then-capped, `U_K(n) = w_K * min(1, n*r/g)`; only weakly concave | decided 2026-11-12 |

**One arm is one parameter vector.** Everything else is derived from the state, so the experiment is clean: the same mechanism, the same seeds, the same suite, and a different point in the parameter space.

### The solver

The objective is **separable and weakly concave per kind**, which is the structure that makes this tractable:

- **gold only** - a group knapsack with concave group values: for each kind, try every count from 0 up, and DP over the budget. `O(budget × kinds × copies)` ≈ 30,000 × 30 × 20 = 18M operations, milliseconds;
- **the floors** - solved first as a feasibility pass: the minimum purchase set that satisfies them, whose cost comes off the budget. That is the "floors first" rule, expressed as a lexicographic constraint rather than as a price;
- **the pack slots** - a second dimension, `#{K : n_K > 0} ≤ slots`. Adding it to the DP makes it `O(budget × slots × kinds × copies)` ≈ 400M, which is too slow for a decision per turn;
- **the weight** - a third dimension, and the same problem.

So there are two candidate solvers, and the choice is a build decision that the zoo can measure:

1. **exact** - the DP over the budget, with the floors first and the slot and weight constraints checked afterwards and repaired if they fail;
2. **near-exact** - the greedy over marginal gains (take the copies with the best marginal usefulness per gold, respecting the floors), then a repair pass that drops or swaps what breaks the slot or weight constraint.

The greedy is the one the old strategy approximates, except that the old one takes the single biggest gain and re-evaluates, which is neither of these.

### What the reduction does not settle

- **the trip model** - a first version landed with phase 1 (depth target, required light and food, escapes, power target) on provisional values the sweep is to refine;
- **the joint treatment** - the program above is joint (the dispositions and the purchases share the gold constraint). Solving it in two stages - decide the dispositions, then buy with what they fetch - is simpler and loses the trades that only exist jointly, such as selling a nearly worthless item to buy the last torch. Whether the two-stage form is good enough is measurable;
- **the option value of an unidentified item** - a range rather than a number, so it does not fit the objective cleanly.

## Worked examples

### P15 - what the solver's form actually costs

The objective is separable and weakly concave per kind, so for each kind the plan knows a table: `n` copies of kind `K` cost `cost_K(n)` and are worth `U_K(n)`, with `U_K` flat then capped. With the alternatives decided (kind-only), a kind's price is not a single number - the first copies come from the cheapest shop - so `cost_K(n)` is the **cumulative cheapest-`n`** cost over the shops' stocks.

**The gold-only problem is an exact DP.** With `dp[b]` = the best usefulness obtainable with gold `≤ b` from the kinds processed so far, and each kind as a group:

```
dp_new[b] = max over n in 0..copies_of(K) of  dp_old[b - cost_K(n)] + U_K(n)
```

`O(budget × kinds × copies)` ≈ 30,000 × 30 × 20 = **18M operations - milliseconds**, and it is exact, because the groups do not interact.

**The pack-slot constraint is a different kind of constraint.** It counts *distinct kinds*, not copies, and the first copy of a kind costs a slot while the second does not. Adding it to the DP means a second dimension, `dp[b][k]` over the kinds used, with the transition tracking whether kind `K` was already started:

```
dp_new[b][k] = max( dp_old[b][k],                                   # take none of K
                    max over n>=1 of dp_old[b - cost_K(n)][k-1] + U_K(n) )
```

`O(budget × slots × kinds × copies)` ≈ 30,000 × 23 × 30 × 20 = **414M - seconds, per re-solve**. The plan re-solves after every action, and the harness runs 165 cases per backend, so the exact DP is not affordable at one decision per turn.

Three ways to handle the slot and weight constraints:

1. **exact DP + repair** - solve the gold-only DP exactly, then drop or swap the kinds that break the slot and weight limits;
2. **Lagrangian relaxation on the kind count** - solve the gold-only DP with a penalty `λ` per kind, and sweep `λ` until the kind count fits. The gold-only DP is cheap, so a binary search over `λ` costs a handful of 18M passes. This is the standard treatment of a knapsack with a cardinality constraint, and it is usually exact or within one item;
3. **greedy over marginal gains + repair** - take the copies with the best marginal usefulness per gold, then repair. This is the cheap one, and it is *not* exact even for the gold-only case.

**What the greedy gives up.** With flat-then-capped values, taking the best ratio first can be wrong. Kind A is worth 12 at a cap of 1 copy and costs 6; kind B is worth 9 per copy at a cap of 2 and costs 5 the copy at the General store - the Black Market asks 3x, but with a cap of 2 both capped copies come from the cheapest source and the 3x price never binds. The purse is 10. The greedy takes A (12/6, the best ratio), then cannot afford a B copy: it scores **12**. The optimum is two B copies for 10 gold: **18**. So the greedy is a heuristic, not a bound; the exact DP is worth its 18M when the constraints allow it.

Which is why P15 is a **build decision the zoo can measure** rather than a preference: the exact form and the near-exact form produce different kits, and the difference shows up in the key log.

### P16 - what the two-stage form loses

The program above is joint because of one line: the proceeds of a sale are budget for a purchase. Deciding the dispositions first, without knowing what will be bought, throws that away.

A concrete case. The character carries an item worth **100** in use and sells for **50**, and has **20 gold**. The shop has one item worth **200** for **20 gold**, and another worth **150** for **20 gold**.

- **joint**: sell the carried item, so the purse is 70; buy both shop items; the kit is worth `0 + 200 + 150 = 350`;
- **two stages**: stage 1 sees use value 100 against a price of 50 and **keeps** it, because it is worth more than it sells for; stage 2 has 20 gold, buys one of the two; the kit is worth `100 + 200 = 300`.

**The two-stage solver never sells an item whose use value exceeds its price**, and that is exactly the "keep the valuable unidentified ware" veto the owner decided to remove. Only a joint program - or a first stage that knows what the money would buy - lets the plan trade a valuable item away when the gold buys more elsewhere.

So P16 is where that decision actually bites: with the veto removed in the extraction, the mechanism that honours it has to be the joint program, not a per-item rule.

## The parts that are to be defined

These are the specifications the redesign needs and does not have yet. Each is a decision, not a line of code.

| # | part | what is missing | decided by |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | **the floor set** | **decided 2026-11-12**: the kit predicates - at least 1 food, at least 1 light, a cure for the current condition, a poison-cure capability. A character may leave town with a floor unmet; what happens then is #37's Stay rules | the owner |
| P2 | **the trip model** | **landed provisionally with phase 1** (2026-11-12): depth target `BI_MAXDEPTH + 5`, 1000 turns per level (anchored on the 2000-turn give-up), one Phase Door per 10 levels, power target `2000 x depth target` - the weakest of the provisional values. The sweep refines them | the owner, then the implementation |
| P3 | **the needs and their deficits** | the **units are decided** (2026-11-11): the fraction of the need closed, the weight the worth of the whole need, and every need split into a floor and a target. The phase-1 deficits landed 2026-11-12; knowledge and trip read 0 until their phases (the catalogue's arrival, #35 item 4, and the stock's) | the owner |
| P5 | **the alternatives** | **decided 2026-11-12**: kind-only. The same kind at 1x in another shop is the alternative; effect-equivalence across kinds is not attempted | the owner |
| P6 | **the caution** | the exact shape of the share cap (`cost <= purse / k`, with `k` as a parameter) and whether it applies to every shop 6 candidate or only to the ones whose kind is otherwise available | the owner |
| P7 | **keep, store, sell, drop** | the thresholds: what makes an item worth storing rather than selling, what makes it worth keeping rather than storing. The Home's slots and the gold are the two currencies | the owner |
| P8 | **the unidentified item** | how the range of possible values of an unidentified item is priced, so that the plan can decide between selling it, keeping it, and buying a copy to learn the kind | the owner |
| P9 | **the identification policy** | when to buy an unidentified copy and when to spend an Identify Rune, and which kinds are worth learning at all - "all useful kinds" is a catalogue that has to be derived, not written | the implementation, from the catalogue |
| P10 | **the equipment** | whether the plan manages the worn kit - the try-on evaluates a candidate by swapping the equipment out, and the plan has to decide whether to keep that or to treat the worn kit as fixed | the implementation |
| P11 | **the Home** | overflow of the pack, or depot for the next trip - two different objectives - and what happens when the Home is full | the owner |
| P12 | **the routing** | whether the floors keep the fast route they have today (food and light from the General store, cures from the Alchemy shop only) or whether the plan routes them like any other purchase | the implementation, from the floors |
| P13 | **the observability** | exactly what the key log records - the plan, the displacement, the utility values - and what the new suites assert. There is no *content* assertion about selling anywhere: the family validators count purchase anchors (`# Buying Scrolls of Phase Door`, `# Buying Potions of Cure Light Wounds`) and nothing checks a sale. The sell behaviour is pinned only transitively, by the parity receipt's key-log comparison. The record schema is a phase-4 prerequisite (decided 2026-11-12): it comes before shadow mode, so the shadow runs already record | the owner, then the implementation |
| P15 | **the solver's exact form** | the objective is separable and weakly concave per kind, so the gold-only problem is an exact group knapsack over the `cost_K(n)` tables (`O(budget x kinds x copies)`, about 18M) with the gold bound `min(purse + proceeds, the total cost)` - but the pack-slot constraint adds a second dimension (about 400M, too slow per decision) and the weight a third. The worked instance above has the greedy score 12 where the optimum is 18: the greedy is a heuristic, not a bound. **Recommendation (2026-11-12): the exact gold DP, with the Lagrangian sweep over the kind count as the slot treatment.** Phase 3's entry criterion is the B2 write-up of this choice | the implementation |
| P16 | **the joint treatment** | whether the dispositions and the purchases are solved jointly (one program, sharing the gold constraint) or in two stages, and what the two-stage form loses - the trades that only exist jointly, such as selling a nearly worthless item to buy the last torch | the implementation, then the sweep |
| P14 | **the migration** | when the default moves, and what the receipt requires to be re-earned. The v11R receipt is 45/45 on the full suite and 105/105 runs; a new default voids it. The settings plumbing is the one exception: it changes the parser table the C reads, so the receipt was re-run and re-earned at phase 0 (now 57/57), with the plan off | the owner |

## What is not in the redesign

- the dungeon behaviour: the character still uses what it carries, and the decisions about what to *use* are not part of this;
- the C Borg: it stays the oracle for the old algorithm, and the Rust port's divergence from it is a decision to be taken separately (see the epic);
- the money-scum mode: the null arm `borg_town_no_stores` is incompatible with it (the arm's contract is that no TownAction is ever executed, and money-scumming is a TownAction loop), unless the owner decides otherwise (see #37);
- the harness suites themselves: they are reworked, not rewritten, and the rework happens with the phases.

## Compatibility

- the plan is **off by default** on the branch; `main` is untouched and keeps its receipt;
- **the redesign voids the C/Rust town parity, and that is not a choice.** The receipt compares the complete key logs, so any change to what the Borg buys or sells diverges from the C Borg by construction. The C Borg stays the oracle for the old algorithm; the new town behaviour has no C counterpart, which is why the arms are Rust-only and the Rust default is their control;
- the two existing gates (`borg_buy_strategy`, `borg_buy_identify`) stay as they are until the plan replaces them, and the plan's arms are what the zoo measures;
- the suites that assert the current algorithm's shape - `family-buying`, `family-identify` - are reworked when the plan lands, not extended;
- the C files the port touches stay byte-identical unless the redesign needs to change a shared rule, in which case the receipt is re-earned. The settings plumbing is that exception, once: the twelve settings land in the C parser table so the C oracle reads them and ignores them, which changes the corpus the receipt covers - so the receipt is re-run and re-earned at phase 0, with the plan off.
