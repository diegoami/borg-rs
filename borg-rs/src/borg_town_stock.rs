//! Phase 2 of the town inventory redesign (borg-rs#36): the stock, the
//! plan's input.
//!
//! The stock turns the world into three lists:
//!
//! * the **candidates** - every ware in every purchasable shop (0..6; the
//!   Home is not a shop), each with its per-copy price, the copies the shop
//!   holds, its per-copy weight, and the slot accounting: whether a copy
//!   stacks into a stack the pack already holds (`slots_cost` 0) or opens a
//!   new one (`slots_cost` 1), and how many copies of the kind the pack
//!   already carries;
//! * the **pack** and the **Home** as groups of stacks, keyed by kind - a
//!   kind can occupy more than one stack (two stacks that do not stack with
//!   each other), and the pack's slots are counted per distinct stack, not
//!   per copy (S3);
//! * the **alternatives**, kind-only (decided 2026-11-12, #35 item 5): every
//!   ware of a kind is an alternative source for that kind, ordered cheapest
//!   first, and the price of `n` copies is the cumulative cheapest-`n`
//!   across the shops. That is what makes the Black Market's 3x price
//!   meaningful: it binds only once the 1x copies run out. Effect
//!   equivalence across kinds is not attempted.
//!
//! The stacking predicate is a parameter. In production it is the Borg's
//! own `borg_object_similar` (`borg_store_sell.rs`), which also enforces
//! the kind's stack limit; the builder [`Stock::build`] takes it as a
//! closure so a test binary can run without the engine.
//!
//! Two known approximations, both on the safe side of the slot count:
//! ammunition is accounted against the pack, though the game puts it in
//! the quiver (whose occupied slots come off the pack's capacity, which
//! the budget reads through `BI_QUIVER_SLOTS`); and the stack
//! classes ask `borg_object_similar`, whose stack limit is checked
//! against the *held* stack's count, so two large shop stacks of one kind
//! can land in separate classes and count a slot each.
//!
//! What the stock does **not** carry: the reduction table that maps a ware
//! to the (need, reduction) pairs it serves. Its catalogue of useful kinds
//! is still open (#35 item 4), so it is not invented here; the candidates
//! carry kind, tval and sval so the table can key on them when it lands.
//! The urgent needs' classification ([`needs_served`]) is the one part of that
//! table the phase-2 budget needs, and it mirrors what `borg_trait` counts.
//!
//! Nothing in production calls this module yet; every public item carries
//! a self-removing `expect(dead_code)` marker, as phase 1's do.
