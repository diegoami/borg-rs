# The baseline of inventory choices

What the current Borg does in town, at real states, so that the new
algorithm can be checked against it. The fixture is the
machine-readable half (`town-baseline.jsonl`); this is the readable half.

## The runs

Harvested at the control commit `7973c0ea`, with the Rust Borg and
the dump on. The dump is observation only, so the control policy is
today's behaviour and the keypress stream is the same as the C Borg's.

| run | visits | distinct states |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `warrior-201` | 40 | 21 |
| `warrior-202` | 41 | 19 |
| `warrior-203` | 79 | 31 |
| `mage-301` | 64 | 30 |
| `mage-302` | 124 | 57 |
| `mage-303` | 82 | 39 |
| `priest-401` | 83 | 40 |
| `priest-402` | 59 | 31 |
| `priest-403` | 65 | 33 |

Together: **637 visits, 301 distinct (state, choice) pairs, 274 distinct states, 34 distinct choices**.

## The distinct choices

What the control actually chooses, by the kind of the thing chosen. The
slot is not the identity: a shop's stock shifts, so the same kind sits
in different slots in different states.

## How the fixture was made

The Borg re-decides the same thing every turn while it walks to the
shop, and the state does not change while it walks, so the raw dump
repeats each decision. The fixture keeps one record per distinct
(state, choice) pair: the state signature - the record without its
version, its record number and its turn - is what decides.

- **637 visits** became **301 records**;
- those are **274 distinct states**, and **34 distinct choices**.

**The control's choice is not a function of the state.** It carries a
standing goal from the turn before, so the same state can carry two
choices: **27** of the 274 states do. The fixture keeps
both, because each is a fact about the control. A new algorithm that
is a function of the state will agree with at most one of them, and
that is the comparison.

The fixture keeps the first record of each pair, in the order the runs
were made. The `seq` is the one the run gave it, so each record points
back at the run it came from:

The raw dumps the fixture is made from stay outside the repository:
they are runs, not source. The fixture is the curated part.

## What it can and cannot settle

- It **can** say where the new algorithm disagrees with the current
  one: the fixture is a state and a choice, and the new algorithm
  answers the same question about the same state.
- It **cannot** be the whole comparison. The power need prices a
  candidate with the try-on, which reads the item bonuses the engine
  holds - the record does not carry those. So the full comparison
  runs in game, where the engine is there: the shadow-plan mode
  (phase 4) puts the two decisions side by side in one record.
- It **does not** claim the current choices are right. It says what
  they are.
