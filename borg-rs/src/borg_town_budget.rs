//! Phase 2 of the town inventory redesign (borg-rs#36): the budget, the
//! constraints the solver respects.
//!
//! * **the urgent needs** - bought first, before anything else (owner
//!   decision, 2026-11-14: there are no urgent needs; an urgent need is one the
//!   character has **now** with **no other way** to meet it - see
//!   [`urgent_needs`]). The urgent pass picks the cheapest set of wares
//!   that meets as many of them as the purse allows: the most met first,
//!   then the least gold, then the fewest wares, then the earliest wares.
//!   It is exact (at most four urgent needs, so at most fifteen distinct
//!   ways a ware can serve them). An urgent need no shop serves, or the
//!   purse cannot pay for, is recorded as unmet and does not block the
//!   visit. Urgent purchases are not priced, so the caution cap does not
//!   apply to them;
//! * **gold** - the purse minus what the urgent needs cost. No trip reserve, no
//!   savings. The proceeds of sales join it in the joint treatment (phase
//!   5), not here;
//! * **pack slots** - the pack's capacity (`pack_size`, 23, less the slots
//!   the quiver takes) minus one slot **per distinct stack** carried (S3),
//!   minus the slots the urgent purchases open;
//! * **Home slots** - the Home's capacity (`store_inven_max`, 24) minus its
//!   stacks;
//! * **weight** - the carry allowance minus the carried weight, minus the
//!   urgent purchases. The allowance is half of `BI_CARRY`, the point past
//!   which `borg_trait` charges the encumbrance against the speed.
//!
//! The slot, Home and weight figures are signed: a urgent purchase can push
//! one below zero, which says the dispositions (phase 4) have to free room
//! before the urgent needs fit. The urgent pass itself is bounded by the gold
//! alone.
//!
//! Nothing in production calls this module yet; every public item carries
//! a self-removing `expect(dead_code)` marker, as phase 1's do.
